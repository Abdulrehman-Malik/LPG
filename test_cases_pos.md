## Cylinder Sale — Physical Cylinder Selection Regression

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| POS-115 | Cylinder Sale → Empty cylinder, select type and enter quantity | Empty Cylinder Price defaults from Cylinder Type Setup; Gas Rate/Gas KG are not used; amount = quantity × empty-cylinder price. |
| POS-116 | Empty Cylinder Sale posting | Only selected/allocated empty physical-cylinder stock decreases; gas stock remains unchanged. |
| POS-117 | Cylinder Sale → Filled cylinder, select type | Available filled and partially-filled physical cylinders appear in a checkbox grid showing physical code, type/capacity, gas KG and status. |
| POS-118 | Select one filled physical cylinder | Cylinder Qty becomes 1 read-only; Gas KG becomes the selected cylinder's current gas quantity read-only. |
| POS-119 | Select multiple filled physical cylinders | Cylinder Qty and Gas KG are calculated automatically from the selected physical cylinders; neither can be manually edited. |
| POS-120 | Change Gas Rate on filled-cylinder sale | Gas KG remains unchanged/read-only; line amount recalculates using the changed gas rate. |
| POS-121 | Change Cylinder Price on filled-cylinder sale | Gas KG remains unchanged; line amount recalculates using the changed cylinder price. |
| POS-122 | Try to manually edit Gas KG on filled-cylinder sale | Field cannot be edited; server ignores any client-supplied gas quantity and derives gas from locked physical cylinders. |
| POS-123 | Try to manually change filled-cylinder quantity | Quantity is read-only and remains equal to selected physical-cylinder count. |
| POS-124 | Same physical cylinder selected in two lines | UI/server rejects duplicate physical-cylinder selection; transaction is not posted. |
| POS-125 | Physical cylinder becomes unavailable before posting | Server revalidates/locks the selected physical cylinders and rejects the sale with a clear retry message; no partial posting occurs. |
| POS-126 | Partially-filled cylinder selected | Gas KG equals the cylinder's actual current gas quantity; cylinder is sold and gas stock is reduced by that exact quantity. |
| POS-127 | Empty + Filled cylinders in one Cylinder Sale | Both lines can coexist; empty line affects cylinder stock only, filled line affects physical cylinder and gas stock. |
| POS-128 | Discount on mixed Cylinder Sale | Existing discount/Net Receivable/Receipt/OS calculations remain correct. |
| POS-129 | Existing customer credit rules on Cylinder Sale | Existing customer Allow Credit Sale, OS and credit-limit rules remain unchanged. |
| POS-130 | Walk-in Cylinder Sale with unpaid balance | Existing Walk-in cash/full-payment rule remains enforced. |
| POS-131 | Void posted Cylinder Sale | Gas and physical-cylinder inventory movements are fully reversed and the original sale remains visible as VOID. |
| POS-132 | Gas Sale / Refill regression after Cylinder Sale changes | Existing Gas Sale / Refill UI, KG/Rs mode, source-cylinder logic and posting behavior remain unchanged. |


## P. Independent Security Deposit / Gas OS Accounting Regression

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Result TRUE/FALSE | Actual Result / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POS-133 | Issue gas/cylinder + deposit | Customer takes filled cylinder with gas/cylinder charge Rs.3,000 and Security Deposit Rs.5,000; pay both fully. | Gas/cylinder payment is recorded as sale payment; Rs.5,000 is recorded separately as Security Deposit Receive; deposit does not settle gas charge. | | |
| POS-134 | Deposit affects OS | Enable Include Security Deposit in Party OS; issue with gas/cylinder charge fully paid and deposit Rs.5,000. | Gas OS remains 0; Deposit Balance = Rs.5,000; Deposit OS = +Rs.5,000; Overall OS = Rs.5,000. | | |
| POS-135 | Deposit does not affect OS | Disable Include Security Deposit in Party OS; issue with fully paid gas/cylinder charge and deposit Rs.5,000. | Deposit Balance = Rs.5,000; Deposit OS = 0; Overall OS contains no deposit amount. | | |
| POS-136 | Deposit cannot settle gas OS | Gas/cylinder charge Rs.3,000; deposit Rs.5,000; do not pay gas amount. | Gas OS = +Rs.3,000 and Deposit Balance = Rs.5,000 independently. Deposit is not used to clear the Rs.3,000 gas OS. | | |
| POS-137 | Deposit refund + return gas | Return gas value Rs.1,000 and refund deposit Rs.5,000 with both OS settings enabled. | Return Gas OS = -Rs.1,000; Deposit OS = -Rs.5,000; refund payment is classified as Security Deposit Refund; neither component settles the other. | | |
| POS-138 | Partial deposit refund | Deposit balance Rs.5,000; refund Rs.2,000. | Deposit balance becomes Rs.3,000; only Rs.2,000 deposit OS is reversed; return-gas OS remains independent. | | |
| POS-139 | Refund cannot exceed deposit | Deposit balance Rs.5,000; attempt refund Rs.6,000. | Entire transaction rejected; no cylinder, stock, deposit or OS changes. | | |
| POS-140 | Payment classification | Open issue/return transaction details after posting. | Gas/cylinder payments show payment type Sale; deposit receipt shows Security Deposit; refund shows Security Deposit Refund. | | |
| POS-141 | Deposit balance source | Create multiple deposit receives/refunds across cylinders. | Refundable deposit balance equals deposits received minus deposits refunded; gas sales/return gas do not change it. | | |

## Q. Legacy Gas Sale / Refill Regression After Deposit Changes

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Result TRUE/FALSE | Actual Result / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POS-142 | Existing Gas Sale / Refill | Perform normal Gas Sale / Refill without security deposit. | Existing gas-sale/refill posting, stock deduction, payment and OS behavior remains unchanged. | | |
| POS-143 | Gas Sale with existing deposit | Customer already has refundable Security Deposit and deposit OS setting is ON; make a normal gas refill and pay the refill amount. | Refill payment settles only the gas/refill component; existing deposit is not consumed or reduced. | | |
| POS-144 | Gas Sale credit with existing deposit | Customer has Security Deposit balance and gas refill is posted on credit. | New gas OS increases only by unpaid refill amount; deposit balance remains unchanged. | | |
| POS-145 | Existing refill source-cylinder flow | Run existing source-cylinder ON and OFF refill scenarios. | Source selection/automatic allocation, gas quantities, physical-cylinder balances and refill history remain workable. | | |

| POS-142 | Combined deposit + gas payment | Security Deposit / Issue Cylinder with gas charge and deposit; one Amount Received | POS displays Total Due and allocates payment according to Shop Settings while keeping sale/deposit payment classifications separate. | | |
| POS-143 | Gas-first allocation | Allocation rule = Gas / Cylinder First | Gas/cylinder charge (including previous gas OS) is allocated first; remaining payment is classified as Security Deposit. | | |
| POS-144 | Deposit-first allocation | Allocation rule = Security Deposit First | Deposit is allocated first; remaining payment is classified as Gas / Cylinder Sale. Security Deposit never becomes sale revenue. | | |
| POS-145 | Manual allocation | Allocation rule = Manual Allocation | Cashier-entered gas and deposit allocations equal Amount Received and each stays within its due amount. | | |
| POS-146 | Other transaction types unaffected | Run Gas Sale, Cylinder Sale, and Cylinder Return | Existing payment workflows continue to validate/post correctly. | | |
