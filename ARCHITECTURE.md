# Perfect LPG — Core Business Logic Architecture

## Layering

Browser / Mobile Browser
-> Bootstrap + jQuery
-> AJAX/API
-> CodeIgniter Controllers
-> Application Services
-> Models/Repositories/Validators
-> MySQL

Controllers should not contain financial posting logic.

## Core Services

### SalesService
- Validate sale scenario and lines.
- Resolve current rates.
- Calculate KG and totals.
- Detect custom rates.
- Validate walk-in restrictions.
- Lock/read customer balance for credit validation.
- Post sale, payments, inventory and cash atomically.
- Write audit log.

### InventoryService
Source of truth:
- opening balances
- immutable inventory movements

Track:
- filled physical cylinders by type and actual gas weight
- empty physical cylinders by type

Gas KG is a derived value, never an independent stock entity:
`available_gas_kg = SUM(cylinder_units.gas_weight_kg) WHERE status = 'filled'`.

Use reversal movements instead of deleting posted movements.

### CashService
Source of truth for Counter Cash:
- opening float
- cash sales
- customer cash receipts
- cash purchases
- supplier cash payments
- cash expenses
- manual cash in/out
- handover
- closing reconciliation

Cheque and online payments create no Counter Cash movement.

### RateService
- Current gas/KG rate.
- Current cylinder price rate.
- Effective-dated rate history.
- Old/new change log.
- Rate override authorization.

### PurchaseService
- Supplier purchase.
- Purchase lines.
- Purchase payments.
- Inventory IN.
- Supplier balance.

### ReportService
Reports are derived from posted transaction tables and ledgers, not mutable dashboard totals.

## Credit Rule

previous_balance = customer outstanding before sale
current_credit = credit part of current sale
new_balance = previous_balance + current_credit

Reject when:
new_balance > credit_limit

unless a manager-approval feature is explicitly added.

## Walk-in Rule

customer_id = NULL means:
- CASH only
- no credit
- no cheque
- no online
- no cylinder return/intake
- no customer outstanding

## Five POS Transaction Scenarios

| Scenario | Gas | Filled cylinder | Empty cylinder | Price |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Sell Gas Only | OUT by entered KG | Source physical unit is partially consumed or converted to empty when fully consumed | IN only when a source unit is fully consumed | Gas/KG only |
| Same-Capacity Replacement | OUT by actual filled-unit gas | OUT | IN same type | Gas/KG only |
| Filled + Gas | OUT by actual filled-unit gas | OUT | No return | Gas/KG + cylinder price |
| Different-Capacity Replacement | OUT by actual filled-unit gas | OUT | IN received type | Gas/KG + cylinder price |
| Empty Only | No change | No change | OUT | Cylinder price only |

Every posted scenario is part of the sales/payment ledger. Customer credit increases only by the credit portion of the posted sale, subject to the customer's credit limit.

## POS UX

Desktop:
- Customer/transaction panel
- Line-entry grid
- Totals/payment panel
- Large Save/Print action

Mobile:
- Stacked cards
- Searchable cylinder selector
- Large numeric fields
- Sticky total/payment footer
- Collapsible balance panel

Credit block:
Previous OS Balance
+ Current Credit
= New OS Balance
Credit Limit
Available Credit

Custom-rate lines must be visibly highlighted.

## Physical Cylinder Inventory

Each filled physical cylinder is represented by a `cylinder_units` record with a unique unit code, cylinder type, status and actual gas weight. Actual gas may be below rated capacity but cannot exceed capacity. Filled-cylinder sales, purchases, stock adjustments and wastage update both the physical unit and the immutable inventory movement ledger.

## Wastage Behavior

Partial wastage deducts only the recorded gas loss from the physical cylinder's `gas_weight_kg`; the derived gas stock therefore decreases automatically while the cylinder remains filled with its remaining gas. If the recorded wastage equals all remaining gas, the physical cylinder is moved to empty stock. Wastage is limited by the configured shop/type percentage or fixed-KG allowance and is recorded with physical unit, user, reason and timestamp.
