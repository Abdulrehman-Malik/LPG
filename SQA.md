# Perfect LPG — SQA Functional Test Plan

## Purpose

This document is the execution checklist for SQA. Execute the application end-to-end in the order below, record the actual observed result for every use case, and update **Status** and **Comments**.

**Important:** Do not mark a case PASS unless it was actually executed and observed in the configured test environment.

### Status values

- **NOT EXECUTED** — not yet tested
- **PASS** — actual result matches expected result
- **FAIL** — actual result differs from expected result
- **BLOCKED** — cannot execute because a prerequisite/environment issue prevents testing
- **N/A** — formally not applicable

### Test environment

- Application: Perfect LPG POS & ERP
- URL: `http://localhost:180/LPG2/LPG/public/`
- Login: `admin / admin123` on a fresh development database
- Database: MySQL 8+
- PHP: 8.2+
- Browser: Chrome/Edge current stable
- Test database: use a disposable SQA database or a reset copy of `perfect_lpg`
- Use test names/codes prefixed with `SQA-` so test transactions are identifiable.

### Evidence rule

For financial/inventory cases, capture enough evidence to reconcile:
1. Before transaction stock/balance.
2. Input values.
3. Document/transaction number.
4. After transaction stock/balance.
5. Relevant receipt/report/audit entry.

## Current Build / SQA Baseline — October 2026

### Automated pre-SQA gate

The latest GitHub Actions build has passed:

- **LPG CI #20**
- Commit: `f19b68e730d49ba5b40be9ed98d4c0b9b407f7ae`
- PHP syntax: PASS
- Composer installation: PASS
- MySQL 8 schema bootstrap: PASS
- Current migrations: PASS
- CodeIgniter `php spark`: PASS
- PHPUnit: **5/5 tests, 6 assertions**
- CI PHPUnit coverage is disabled because no coverage driver is installed.

This is a prerequisite quality gate only. It does not replace execution of this SQA matrix in a browser against a disposable test database.

### Current POS model — use this for new SQA cases

The current POS model is **header-level, one transaction type per invoice**:

| Code | Current transaction |
|---|---|
| `gas_sale` | Gas Sale / Refill |
| `cylinder_sale` | Cylinder Sale |
| `security_deposit` | Security Deposit / Issue Cylinder |
| `cylinder_return` | Cylinder Return / Refund Deposit |

Older five-mode test cases already present in this document are retained as historical/regression coverage. **For new testing and defect analysis, use the four current transaction types above.**

### Current gas-sale rules

- Gas quantity is measured in KG.
- **Gas KG is a derived value, not an independent inventory entity.** Available gas is always the sum of `gas_weight_kg` from company-owned physical cylinders whose status is `filled`.
- Selling 1 KG consumes only 1 KG of gas; it does not consume a complete cylinder.
- With **Individual Cylinder Tracking OFF** (default), normal POS shows aggregate available gas for the selected cylinder type rather than asking the cashier to choose a physical source cylinder.
- Backend automatically allocates the requested gas across available filled physical cylinders of that cylinder type.
- The backend continues to maintain physical cylinder records and actual gas weight.
- When a physical cylinder reaches 0 KG, it becomes empty and corresponding filled-out/empty-in inventory movements are recorded.
- Customer custody cylinders remain physical-unit based for security-deposit, return and custody-refill workflows.

### Current inventory rules

- Physical `cylinder_units` are the authoritative current stock records for filled and empty cylinders.
- Filled cylinder records contain cylinder type, physical unit code, status and actual gas weight.
- Available Gas KG is derived from the actual gas weight of currently filled physical cylinders; no purchase, opening, adjustment or sale may create an independent gas stock balance.
- Actual gas weight cannot exceed cylinder capacity.
- Opening inventory supports filled and empty physical cylinders.
- Manual stock +/- movements are handled through the dedicated Stock Adjustment & History screen.
- Inventory Detail Report identifies partially used company cylinders based on remaining gas between 0 and capacity.

### Current customer/payment rules

- Previous customer OS is included in the current receivable.
- Payments are applied to previous OS first, then the current sale.
- Remaining balance carries forward as customer OS.
- Credit validation supports branch modes: none, customer, or shop.
- Security deposit amounts are tracked separately from ordinary revenue/customer OS.

### Current permissions/SQA expectation

The sidebar is permission-aware. A user should only see menu items for permissions they actually have, and direct unauthorized route access must still be denied by the controller/service guard.

### Browser testing environment

For remote browser/E2E testing, do not use a production environment.

Recommended:
`Windows PC + XAMPP + MySQL -> Cloudflare Tunnel -> HTTPS staging URL`

Use:
- separate disposable SQA database;
- dedicated SQA users;
- test customers/suppliers/cylinders prefixed `SQA-`;
- no production credentials;
- no production data.

A localhost URL is suitable for local SQA execution but is not itself a remote staging URL.

### New current-model SQA focus

Before considering the application release-ready, explicitly execute and record:
1. Default POS transaction type from Shop Settings.
2. Gas Sale / Refill using KG quantities.
3. Aggregate gas availability by cylinder type with individual tracking OFF.
4. Automatic allocation across multiple physical filled cylinders.
5. Exact transition from filled to empty at 0 KG.
6. Cylinder Sale quantity against physical cylinder availability.
7. Security Deposit / Issue Cylinder custody and deposit ledger.
8. Cylinder Return / Refund Deposit against the customer's custody cylinder.
9. Customer OS + partial payment allocation.
10. Credit-limit validation.
11. Stock Adjustment +/− and history, including the rule that gas changes must target a physical cylinder rather than a bulk gas bucket.
12. Inventory Detail Report and partially used-cylinder visibility.
13. Permission-aware sidebar and unauthorized route protection.
14. Thermal receipt and browser/JavaScript regression.
15. End-to-end reconciliation of POS, inventory, cash, customer ledger, security deposits and audit logs.


## Environment Configuration Rule — Important

- **Never add Cloudflare/tunnel-specific URL logic to application code.**
- The application must use the normal CodeIgniter `app.baseURL` configuration from the local `.env` file.
- For staging, set `app.baseURL` in the staging machine's local `.env` to the staging HTTPS URL.
- For production, set `app.baseURL` in the production machine's local `.env` to the production URL.
- Do not commit tunnel URLs, environment-specific hostnames, production URLs, or environment secrets to the repository.
- Testing infrastructure may use external URLs, but it must not require application-code changes to accommodate a temporary tunnel.

| J09 | Walk-in non-cash blocked | Select Walk-in / Cash and choose cheque, online or credit | POS rejects posting; walk-in is cash-only | NOT EXECUTED |
| J10 | Customer credit not configured | Select an actual customer whose Allow Credit Sale is OFF and attempt a partial/credit sale | POS and server reject the sale with a clear credit-not-allowed message | NOT EXECUTED |
| J11 | Customer credit within limit | Enable Allow Credit Sale; configure a positive credit limit; make a sale whose resulting outstanding is within the limit | Sale posts and customer outstanding increases only by the credit amount | NOT EXECUTED |
| J12 | Customer credit limit exceeded | Enable Allow Credit Sale; attempt credit that makes resulting outstanding exceed Credit Limit | POS and server reject the sale; no partial inventory/cash/ledger posting remains | NOT EXECUTED |
| J13 | Zero customer credit limit | Enable Allow Credit Sale but set Credit Limit to zero; attempt unpaid balance | Credit sale is rejected because resulting outstanding cannot exceed zero | NOT EXECUTED |
| J14 | Direct POST bypass attempt | Bypass browser controls and submit a credit sale for a customer with Allow Credit Sale OFF or over limit | SalesService rejects the request; UI-only restrictions are not the security boundary | NOT EXECUTED |

### Mandatory business rule

- Walk-in customer = cash-only and **sale total must equal received amount**.
- Actual customer = credit only when **Allow Credit Sale** is enabled on the customer record.
- Customer credit = resulting outstanding must not exceed the customer's configured **Credit Limit**.
- These rules are enforced server-side and must not be disabled by the branch-level credit-limit validation mode setting.


## Source Filled Cylinder Selection Tests

- **J15** — Shop Settings ON: Source Filled Cylinder dropdown is visible on Gas Sale.
- **J16** — Shop Settings ON: same physical source cylinder on two lines is rejected.
- **J17** — Shop Settings ON: source-cylinder quantity above available KG is rejected.
- **J18** — Shop Settings ON: sale deducts gas only from the selected physical cylinder; when its remaining gas reaches zero it becomes empty.
- **J19** — Shop Settings OFF: source dropdown is hidden and gas is allocated automatically by ascending physical-cylinder sequence.
- **J20** — Shop Settings OFF: allocation consumes one cylinder down to zero before moving to the next cylinder.
- **J21** — Shop Settings OFF: gas quantity above the selected cylinder type's total available KG is rejected.
- **J22** — Same cylinder type on multiple gas-sale lines is rejected in both ON and OFF modes.
- **J23** — Cylinder Type dropdown displays available gas grouped by cylinder type.
- **J24** — Concurrent gas sales cannot oversell the same physical-cylinder quantity because source rows are locked inside the posting transaction.
