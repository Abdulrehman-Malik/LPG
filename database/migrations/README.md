# Perfect LPG — Database Migration Deployment Order

All manual SQL migrations in this directory use the format:

```
NNN_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
```

The **NNN** prefix is the deployment sequence. The date remains in the filename so the feature/change date is still visible.

## Deployment rules

The application now checks this directory on the login page. A pending migration is shown there with an **Execute Pending Migrations** button. Migrations are executed strictly by numeric sequence, one at a time. If one migration fails, execution stops immediately and later migrations remain pending.

Execution results are recorded in `lpg_migration_history`, including status, checksum, start/end time, duration, executed statement count, and the error message for failures. Login is blocked until every migration is successfully applied. An already-applied migration file may not be changed; create a new sequence instead.


1. Run `database/schema.sql` only for a fresh database.
2. For an existing database, run only the migration scripts that have not already been applied.
3. Always execute pending migrations in ascending sequence order: **001 → 002 → ... → 027 → 028 → 029**.
4. Migration **011** is not a normal upgrade migration. It is a controlled, destructive transactional-data refresh intended for disposable staging/test databases. Its refresh list is authoritative for transactional/test state: whenever a later migration introduces a new transactional table, update the controlled refresh script/rule so that table is reset too, while master/configuration data remains preserved.
5. Do not automatically run migration 011 during production deployment.
6. Do not rename or reorder an already released migration. Add a new sequence number for every future migration.
7. Keep migration files idempotent where practical so a partially completed deployment can be safely retried.

## Fresh database

The current `database/schema.sql` already contains the current application schema. For a fresh database, use the schema first and apply only migrations needed for compatibility/testing of an existing-installation path.

## Existing database

Before deployment, identify the latest sequence already applied and continue from the next pending sequence. The numeric prefix is the authoritative execution order; the date is informational.

## Staging refresh

To intentionally reset transactional/test data:

```sql
USE perfect_lpg;
SET @lpg_refresh_transactional_data = 1;
SOURCE database/migrations/011_20261003_refresh_transactional_data.sql;
```

Never execute the staging refresh against production unless a deliberate full transactional reset is explicitly intended.

## Future migration naming standard

Use:

```
012_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
014_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
015_YYYYMMDD_feature_name.sql
```

Never reuse an existing sequence number.

- `014_20261004_pos_source_filled_cylinder_selection.sql` — adds the branch-level POS setting controlling manual source filled-cylinder selection versus automatic sequential allocation.
- `019_20261005_stock_adjustment_history.sql` — adds dedicated stock-adjustment transaction headers, references, reasons, and before/after snapshots.


## Credit Sale / OS Rules

- A credit sale exists when a sale is not fully paid and therefore increases customer OS.
- Existing customer OS is included when validating a new credit sale.
- Customer Allow Credit Sale is stored in customers.allow_credit_sale and defaults to OFF.
- credit_limit_validation_mode values are none, customer, and shop.
- none means no credit-limit restriction; customer validates the selected customer's projected OS; shop validates projected positive OS across the branch and ignores individual customer credit limits.
- Shop-level validation uses a branch-wide database lock to prevent concurrent credit sales from collectively exceeding the shop limit.
- These rules are enforced server-side; POS display/JavaScript is only an early user-feedback layer.
